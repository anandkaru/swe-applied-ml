# PrimeApple Review Insight Pipeline - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the end-to-end insight pipeline for PrimeApple's customer reviews. The pipeline transforms raw customer reviews into actionable, executive-ready summaries with data-backed themes.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing** (`src/data_loader.py`)
   - Loads CSV data with validation
   - Cleans and preprocesses review text
   - Handles missing data and edge cases

2. **Semantic Embedding** (`src/embedding_generator.py`)
   - Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for CPU-friendly embeddings
   - Implements batch processing for efficiency
   - Caches embeddings for reproducible runs

3. **Theme Discovery** (`src/theme_discovery.py`)
   - K-Means clustering with optimal K selection
   - Uses silhouette score and elbow method
   - Ensures determinism with fixed random seed

4. **Sentiment Analysis** (`src/sentiment_analyzer.py`)
   - Uses `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest`
   - Provides positive/negative/neutral classification
   - Aggregates sentiment at theme level

5. **LLM Summarization** (`src/llm_summarizer.py`)
   - OpenAI GPT-4 for high-quality summaries
   - Structured prompts for consistent output
   - Fallback mechanisms for API failures

6. **Quote Selection** (`src/quote_selector.py`)
   - Multi-criteria scoring system
   - Ensures sentiment and rating diversity
   - Selects 3 representative quotes per theme

7. **Storage Management** (`src/storage_manager.py`)
   - SQLite database for persistence
   - Versioned results with metadata
   - Export capabilities (CSV/JSON)

## üîß Key Design Decisions

### Semantic Representation
- **Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions)
- **Rationale**: CPU-friendly, fast inference, good semantic understanding
- **Persistence**: Joblib caching for reproducible runs

### Theme Discovery
- **Algorithm**: K-Means with StandardScaler preprocessing
- **K Selection**: Automated using silhouette score (‚â•0.3 threshold) and elbow method
- **Range**: 5-10 clusters for manageable insights
- **Determinism**: Fixed random seed (42)

### LLM Prompting Strategy
- **Model**: GPT-4 (configurable to GPT-3.5-turbo for cost)
- **Temperature**: 0.3 for consistent outputs
- **Prompt Design**:
  - Clear business context
  - Specific constraints (‚â§8 words title, ‚â§50 words summary)
  - JSON output format for parsing
  - Emphasis on actionable insights
- **Fallback System**: Intelligent content-based theme extraction when LLM fails

### Quote Selection Criteria
1. **Length**: Prefer 50-200 characters
2. **Specificity**: Score based on feature mentions
3. **Sentiment Diversity**: Ensure representation across sentiments
4. **Clarity**: Well-written, understandable text
5. **Uniqueness**: Avoid repetitive quotes with similar content

## üìä Output Schema

### Database Tables

#### `runs`
- Pipeline execution metadata
- LLM settings, cluster count, token cost

#### `clusters`
- Theme information with sentiment mix
- Volume percentage and product distribution

#### `quotes`
- Representative quotes with metadata
- Links to themes via foreign keys

## üöÄ Usage

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
```

### Running the Pipeline
```bash
# Full pipeline
python pipeline.py run

# Demo with small dataset
python demo.py

# Test components
python test_pipeline.py

# View results
python pipeline.py show-results

# Export results
python pipeline.py export --format csv
```

## üìà Example Output

```
1. EchoPad Battery Life Concerns
   Summary: Customers frequently report dissatisfaction with the EchoPad's battery life, describing it as 'unacceptable' and 'mediocre'. Issues include rapid drain during video calls, gaming, and standby. However, some positive feedback highlights long-lasting battery during varied usage.
   Volume: 21.9%
   Sentiment: 51% positive, 47% negative, 2% neutral
   Representative Quotes:
     1. "Testing sidebyside, the battery life comes off as beyond expectations; it barely moved from 100 after bingereading for 9 hours straight."
     2. "Testing sidebyside, the battery life comes off as beyond expectations; it handles a 6hour workday plus Netflix and finishes with 18 remaining."
     3. "In daily use, the battery life is excellent; it still at 5 after a full weekend camping trip. PrimeApple nailed it this time!"

2. Firmware Updates Impacting Experience
   Summary: Customers report firmware updates on EchoPad products introduce bugs, worsen battery life, and unexpectedly lock dev mode. Despite some positive feedback, improvements are needed to enhance user experience and maintain customer satisfaction.
   Volume: 19.4%
   Sentiment: 45% positive, 54% negative, 1% neutral
```
